## Collaborative Cartography Night: [FixWikiMaps](http://fixwikimaps.tumblr.com)

October 7th, 2015  
MaptimeNYC

**Summary:** Tonight we will be working together in groups to make maps on Wikimedia more beautiful.  We will be channeling the varied talents of all the awesome people at the meetup to talk about map making and design.  

We'll be trying out a few different options for making maps using open source stacks.  We'll use [QGIS Print Composer](http://docs.qgis.org/2.0/en/docs/user_manual/print_composer/print_composer.html) to export maps to [Scalable Vector Graphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) (SVG) documents.  If you're scared by the sounds of desktop map-making software, don't worry - we're also going to try out [CartoDB's Print API](http://blog.cartodb.com/static-maps/).
